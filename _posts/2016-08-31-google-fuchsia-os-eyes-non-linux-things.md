  Google's latest operating system project, Fuchsia, may be largely a mystery,
  but it reinforces a truth that platform vendors are having, grudgingly, to
  acknowledge: one operating system does not fit all. For a company which has
  put so much effort into making Android an OS for all purposes, Google has a
  remarkable number of potentially conflicting platforms, now including Chrome
  OS, Brillo and Fuchsia.
