  A new version of open-source video editor OpenShot 2.1 has been released. The
  latest update to the cross-platform non-linear video editor is a sizeable one
  and adds a number of new features to the tool, including initial animation
  support. Keen animators can play around with multiple layers, transparent
  image sequences and keyframes to create custom compositions.
