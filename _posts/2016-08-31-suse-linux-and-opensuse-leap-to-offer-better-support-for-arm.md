  The YaST development team at openSUSE and SUSE is reporting on the latest
  improvements that should be available in the upcoming openSUSE Leap 42.2 and
  SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service Pack 2 operating systems. The 23rd YaST
  development sprint 23 took place last week, and we're looking at a lot of nice
  features coming soon to the in-house built installation and configuration tool
  for openSUSE and the SUSE Linux Enterprise distributions, such as integration
  of the self-update feature with the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) and
  Subscription Management Tool (SMT) servers.
