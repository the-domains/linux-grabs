  The web is not secure. As of August 2016, only 45.5 percent of Firefox page
  loads are HTTPS, according to Josh Aas, co-founder and executive director of
  Internet Security Research Group. This number should be 100 percent, he said
  in his talk called "Let's Encrypt: A Free, Automated, and Open Certificate
  Authority" at LinuxCon North America.
