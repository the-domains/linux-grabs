description: "There's another weekly point release of the Vulkan high performance graphics API. Vulkan 1.0.11 was released this week with several more clarifications to the documentation, typo fixes, and other relatively mundane changes to the Vulkan 1.0 specification. Likely most noteworthy is the changing of the script/XML/header files (not the specification itself) from the Khronos Free Use License to now the Apache 2.0 license."
