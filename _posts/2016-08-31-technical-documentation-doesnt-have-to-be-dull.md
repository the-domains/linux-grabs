  Earlier this year, I described three important characteristics of good
  documentation: concise, consistent, and simple. Good word choice, I wrote, is
  important for understanding and translation. But that doesn't mean it has to
  be dry and boring. Want to know a secret? My favorite tech books to read are
  the For Dummies books.
