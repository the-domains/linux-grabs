            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Wayland Developer Shares His Concerns About NVIDIA's EGLStreams Proposal - Phoronix</h1><p>Here is an elegant explanation by an upstream Wayland developer about what the consensus outside of NVIDIA mostly comes down to in the EGLStreams vs. GBM debate that's been occupying Wayland stakeholders the past month. There's no end in sight over the discussion of GBM (with the current approach of Wayland compositors) versus EGLStreams (the approach sought after by NVIDIA for their proprietary Linux driver).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5674a5805f77503bd75a99878c396ec20f337483.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google Open-Sources Neural Network Framework And Powerful Language Parser For Smarter AI: Meet Parsey McParseface</h1><p>Google is stepping up its game of open-sourcing tools for improved language parsing in smart AI, and Parsey McParseface is the latest name on the list. The near-unpronounceable software may sound laughable, but it is Google's instrument for understanding English. It is plausible that when they named the module, Google's engineer got inspired by Boaty McBoatface, the British research vessel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a27e65fb0499ef35ea35a893189c04d1a19f20fb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
